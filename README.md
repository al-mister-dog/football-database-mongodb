This serves the interactive football table client using mongoDb. There is another server for the same client that interacts with a [MySql database](https://github.com/al-mister-dog/football-database-mysql).

At the moment the Node/MySql server is more streamlined, requiring less functions and code to do the same job. The goal is to eventually create a stateless server/client stack than can use both mongoDb and mySql. Why can't we all just be friends?
